== Thruk Clustering
{% include new_since.ad version="2.22" %}
Clustered setups provide high-availability and performance improvements at the
price of higher complexity. All Thruk nodes in a cluster must use shared
storage for their `etc_path` and `var_path` while the `tmp_path` should remain
local.


=== Setup

    - Create shared storage for `etc_path` and `var_path`
    - Setup a load balancer
    - Add the node urls to `cluster_node`

=== Features

==== Shared cronjobs
Cluster setups will share their cronjobs, so reports or scheduling recurring
downtimes will only run once in a cluster.

==== High Availability
Having more than one Thruk node with a load-balancer in front will share the
load over all nodes and will still work if at least one node is available.
